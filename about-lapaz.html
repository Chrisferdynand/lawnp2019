       <h5 class="subtitulo">City of La Paz</h5>
       <p class="parrafo">
	   
           <span>La Paz, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world.Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters. Hopefully we have a spring climate for the LAWNP in October, with mild temperatures, and without rain. <br>

		   La Paz has a high variety of altitude, from 3,200 m asl for the lowest part of the city, called "Zona Sur" (South Zone), till 4,000 m asl for the upper part near El Alto and the airport, on the Altiplano plateau. The historic Center is situated at around 3,600 m asl (Plaza Murillo, Plaza San Francisco).<br><br>
		   As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies. The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power. The city hosts all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is the political and financial center of Bolivia; it generates 27% of Bolivia's Gross Domestic Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.<br><br>
		   La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Plaza Murillo and the Jaén Street. The city is renowned for its unique markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the longest, highest and most modern urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city type "Gamma" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).<br>

	   <b>CITIES</b>
	   <br>
	   The main cities in Bolivia are the capitals of each department. The most interesting in an historical and architectural point of view are Sucre and Potosi. Sucre is the constitutional capital of Bolivia, the capital of the Chuquisaca Department and the 6th most populated city in Bolivia. Located in the south-central part of the country, Sucre lies at an elevation of 2,810 meters (9,214 feet). This relatively high altitude gives the city a cool temperate climate year-round. Potosí is one of the highest cities in the world at a nominal 4,090 metres (13,420 ft). For centuries, it was the location of the Spanish colonial mint. Potosí lies at the foot of the Cerro de Potosí, sometimes referred to as the Cerro Rico ("rich mountain"), a mountain popularly conceived of as being "made of" silver ore that dominates the city. The Cerro Rico is the reason for Potosí's historical importance since it was the major supply of silver for Spanish Empire until Guanajuato in Mexico surpassed it in the 18th century. The silver was taken by llama and mule train to the Pacific coast, shipped north to Panama City, and carried by mule train across the isthmus of Panama to Nombre de Dios or Portobelo, whence it was taken to Spain on the Spanish treasure fleets. Some of the silver also made its way east to Buenos Aires, via the Rio de la Plata. From La Paz, you can go to Sucre and Potosi by bus (~14 hours to Sucre, ~10 hours to Potosi) or by plane. You can go easily by bus between Potosi and Sucre (~2-3 hours).<br><br>
	   <b>NATURAL SITES</b> <br>
	   <ul>
	   <li>[1] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salar_de_Uyuni">SALAR DE UYUNI</a>: it is the world's largest salt flat, at 10,582 square kilometers (4,086 sq mi). The Salar was formed as a result of transformations between several prehistoric lakes. It is covered by a few meters of salt crust, which has an extraordinary flatness with the average elevation variations within one meter over the entire area of the Salar. The crust serves as a source of salt and covers a pool of brine, which is exceptionally rich in lithium. It contains 50% to 70% of the world's known lithium reserves. The large area, clear skies, and exceptional flatness of the surface make the Salar an ideal object for calibrating the altimeters of Earth observation satellites. Following rain, a thin layer of dead calm water transforms the flat into the world's largest mirror, 129 kilometres (80 miles) across. A lot of tourism agencies organised tours to visit the Salar. From La Paz, you can go by bus (~10 hours) or by plane until Uyuni. From there, you can book a tour (if you did not do it in La Paz) and visit the salar (1 day by car 4x4) or the entire region (3 days by car 4x4) where you can visit lakes with different colors (green, white, reddish ...), geysers, and observe the flora and fauna.</li><br>
	   <li>[2] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rurrenabaque">RURRENABAQUE</a>: This is a small town in the North of Bolivia on the Beni River. It is the capital of Rurrenabaque Municipality. In recent years it has become popular with international tourism as it is an easy gateway for visits to Madidi National Park (within the Bolivian rainforest), as well as the surrounding pampas. From La Paz, take a flight to Rurrenabaque. There, you can book a tour to visit the pampas or the Amazonian forest, generally for 2-3 days. Don't forget to take protection against mosquitoes. Use clothes covering all your body and good shoes. If you are lucky, during the tour, you can swim with the <a href="https://bolivia-natura.com/the-pink-dolphin-of-bolivia/">Bolivian pink dolphin</a>! There is no malaria in the zone, but you must have the yellow fever vaccin. Dengue or other mosquito-borne disease is possible. Nevertheless, the probability to get them in October is not so high, because it is not the rainy season. Still, we recommend to protect yourself against mosquitoes and to have your health insurance with you. </li><br>
	  <li>[3] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copacabana,_Bolivia">TITICACA LAKE and COPACABANA</a>: Copacabana is the main Bolivian town on the shore of Lake Titicaca. The town has a large 16th-century shrine, the Basilica of Our Lady of Copacabana. Our Lady of Copacabana is the patron saint of Bolivia. The town is a destination for tourism in Bolivia. The town is also known for its famous Basilica, home of the Virgin of Copacabana, its trout, and its quaint atmosphere. Built between Mount Calvario and Mount Niño Calvario, the town has approximately 6,000 inhabitants. Copacabana's religious celebrations, cultural patrimony, and traditional festivals are well known throughout Bolivia. Boats leave for Isla del Sol, the sacred Inca island from Copacabana (~3 hours by boat). The island is very beautiful and peaceful, with no cars, there are two samll ports, you can go by foot from one to another (~4 hours by foot), visiting the island and the ruins. There are a lot of hotels in Copacabana and Isla del Sol, you don't need to book them in advance. From La Paz, you can go to Copacabana by bus (~3-4 hours). </li>
